# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<MinecraftVersion auto />

Quick answers to the most commonly asked questions about Showcase mod.

## General Questions

### What is Showcase mod?

Showcase is a server-side Minecraft mod that allows players to share items, inventories, containers, and statistics through interactive chat links. Players can create temporary shares that others can view in a GUI interface.

### Do players need to install anything?

**No!** Showcase is completely server-side. Players join your server normally without downloading any client-side mods or resource packs (unless you want to use the experimental item icons feature).

### Which Minecraft versions are supported?

<Tabs items={["Current Versions", "Legacy Support", "Version Notes"]}>
  <Tab value="Current Versions">
    **Fully Supported**:
    - Minecraft 1.21.6 (Latest)
    - Minecraft 1.21.5
    - Minecraft 1.21.4
    - Minecraft 1.21.2

    Each version has its own release build optimized for that specific Minecraft version.
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Legacy Support">
    **Previous Versions**:
    - Minecraft 1.21.1 (Limited support)
    - Minecraft 1.21.0 (Limited support)
    - Minecraft 1.20.x (Legacy - use Showcase v1.x)

    <Callout type="warn">
    Legacy versions receive security updates only. Upgrade to supported versions for new features.
    </Callout>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Version Notes">
    **Version Differences**:
    - Each Minecraft version requires its specific Showcase build
    - Features are consistent across supported versions
    - Performance optimizations may vary by version
    - Always use the exact version match
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Is Showcase compatible with Forge?

**No**, Showcase is built for Fabric only. There are no plans for a Forge version due to architectural differences between the platforms.

**Alternatives for Forge servers**:
- Look for similar inventory/item sharing mods on CurseForge
- Consider migrating to Fabric for Showcase support

## Installation and Setup

### How do I install Showcase?

<Callout type="info">
**Quick Install Steps**:
1. Install Fabric Loader on your server
2. Download Fabric API for your MC version
3. Download Showcase for your MC version
4. Place both JARs in the `mods/` folder
5. Start your server
</Callout>

See the complete [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation) for detailed instructions.

### Why isn't Showcase loading?

**Most common causes**:
1. **Wrong Minecraft version** - Use exact version match
2. **Missing Fabric API** - Required dependency
3. **Outdated Java** - Java 21+ required for MC 1.21.x
4. **File corruption** - Re-download the JAR file

Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](/support/troubleshooting) for detailed solutions.

### Do I need LuckPerms?

**LuckPerms is optional but recommended**:
- ‚úÖ **Without LuckPerms**: Basic operator-based permissions
- ‚úÖ **With LuckPerms**: Fine-grained permission control, player groups, temporary permissions

For servers with multiple player groups or complex permission needs, LuckPerms provides much better control.

## Features and Usage

### What can players share?

<Cards>
  <Card title="Items" description="Currently held item with all enchantments and NBT data" />
  <Card title="Inventories" description="Full inventory (36 slots) or just hotbar (9 slots)" />
  <Card title="Ender Chests" description="Personal ender chest contents" />
  <Card title="Containers" description="Chests, barrels, shulker boxes, and more" />
  <Card title="Villager Trades" description="Trading interfaces with pricing" />
  <Card title="Statistics" description="Player stats with detailed categorization" />
</Cards>

### How long do shares last?

**Default Durations** (configurable):
- Items: 30 minutes
- Inventories: 60 minutes
- Containers: 45 minutes
- Statistics: 120 minutes

**Custom Durations**:
Players with permission can set custom durations:
<CommandSyntax>/showcase item Steve 5m "Check this out!"</CommandSyntax>

### What are chat keywords?

Chat keywords allow quick sharing by typing special words in square brackets:

```
Player types: "Check out my [item]!"
Chat shows:  "Check out my [üó°Ô∏è Diamond Sword]!"
```

**Default Keywords**:
- `[item]` or `[i]` - Share held item
- `[inventory]` or `[inv]` - Share inventory
- `[hotbar]` or `[hb]` - Share hotbar
- `[stats]` - Share statistics

## Permissions and Security

### How do permissions work?

Showcase uses a hierarchical permission system:

```
showcase.command.item              # Basic item sharing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ showcase.command.item.receivers    # Can specify who sees it
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ showcase.command.item.duration     # Can set custom duration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ showcase.command.item.description  # Can add descriptions
```

See the [Permissions Guide](/configuration/permissions) for complete details.

### Can players share private information?

**Security Features**:
- Shares expire automatically
- Players control who can view their shares
- Sensitive items can be filtered via configuration
- Rate limiting prevents spam
- Admin commands for monitoring and cleanup

**Best Practices**:
- Set reasonable share durations
- Use permissions to limit features
- Monitor shares with `/showcase-manage list`
- Educate players about sharing responsibly

### How do I prevent sharing in certain areas?

Use permission contexts with LuckPerms:

```bash
# Disable sharing in spawn world
/lp group default permission unset showcase.command.* world=spawn

# Allow only in creative world
/lp group builder permission set showcase.command.container true world=creative
```

## Performance and Limits

### Will Showcase cause lag?

**Performance Impact**: Minimal when properly configured

**Optimization Tips**:
1. **Adjust share limits**:
   ```yaml
   general:
     maxSharesPerPlayer: 5  # Reduce for large servers
   ```

2. **Shorter durations**:
   ```yaml
   shares:
     item:
       defaultDuration: 15  # Reduces memory usage
   ```

3. **Frequent cleanup**:
   ```yaml
   general:
     cleanupInterval: 2  # Clean expired shares more often
   ```

### How many shares can be active?

**Default Limits** (configurable):
- 10 shares per player
- No global limit (memory dependent)
- Automatic cleanup of expired shares

**For Large Servers**:
- Reduce per-player limits
- Shorter default durations
- More frequent cleanup intervals

### Does it work with other mods?

**Generally Compatible** with most mods:
- ‚úÖ Chat enhancement mods
- ‚úÖ Economy mods
- ‚úÖ World management mods
- ‚úÖ Most Fabric mods

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Chat filtering mods (may interfere with keywords)
- Inventory management mods (GUI conflicts possible)
- Custom permission mods (test compatibility)

- Custom plugins using Showcase events
- Database logging and analytics

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "No permission" errors

<Callout type="error">
**Problem**: Commands return "You do not have permission"
</Callout>

**Quick Fixes**:
1. Check if LuckPerms is installed and working
2. Grant basic permissions: `/lp group default permission set showcase.command.item true`
3. For ops: Ensure OP level 2+ for basic features
4. Test with: `/showcase-manage perms <player>`

### Chat keywords not working

<Callout type="error">
**Problem**: `[item]` in chat doesn't create links
</Callout>

**Solutions**:
1. Check configuration: `chatKeywords.enabled: true`
2. Verify permissions: `showcase.chat.item`
3. Check rate limits (may be temporarily blocked)
4. Ensure proper syntax: `[item]` not `(item)` or `{item}`

### Shares not appearing

<Callout type="error">
**Problem**: Commands succeed but shares don't show
</Callout>

**Debugging**:
1. Check if holding item for `/showcase item`
2. Verify share isn't expired immediately
3. Check share limits: `/showcase-manage list`
4. Test with different share types
