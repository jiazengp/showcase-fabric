# Item Sharing

<MinecraftVersion auto />

Share individual items with complete preservation of enchantments, NBT data, and custom names.

## Usage

```
/showcase item [player] [duration] [description]
```

**Examples:**
```
/showcase item                      # Share with everyone
/showcase item Steve 5m "Cool sword" # Share with Steve for 5 minutes
/showcase item @a 1h                # Share with all players for 1 hour
```

## What's Preserved

All item properties are captured completely:
- **Enchantments** - All levels and types including custom modded enchantments
- **Custom Names** - Renamed items, lore text, and formatting
- **NBT Data** - Custom attributes, modded data, and technical properties
- **Durability** - Exact damage values and repair status

## Chat Keywords

Use keywords in square brackets for quick sharing:
- `[item]` or `[i]` - Share currently held item

**Example:**
```
Check out my [item]!
```
